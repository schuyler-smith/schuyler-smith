## Schuyler, Your Code Isn't Working! :rage:

If something doesn't appear to be doing what I promised it should, or if you just want help navigating the sometimes painful installation process, the best thing to do is open an `issue` in the repository! If you aren't comfortable doing that, you are always welcome to email me. I am more than happy to help with any problem, big or small!
